            <p class="aboutText">Kisuke Urahara is an ex-captain of the soul society that currently runs a candy shop in the human realm. He is one of the smartest characters in Bleach as he was the number one researcher in the soul society until he stepped down to settle in the human realm.  He is a tactician that hides his true capabilities while keeping his humerous personality. When it comes down to the moment, Kisuke Urahara is capable of taking down all opponents. However, he usually acts within the shadows and only steals the spotlight when his comrades are in need.

                Kisuke Urahara Bankai form is known as <strong>Kannonbiraki Benihime Aratame.</strong> His bankai form allows him to reconstruct and deconstruct whatever he chooses. This allows him to have destructive attacking power while possesing healing capabilities.

                Without his bankai form, Kisuke still excels in sword to sword combat along with possesing immense spiritual pressure. In his normal form, he stays relatively laid back. He runs a normal candy shop along with three other friends.
